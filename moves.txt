a)The pitch adjustment move-timeslot. An event that
meets the probability of 10%×PAR is randomly
moved to any feasible timeslot where the room is not
changed.

b) The pitch adjustment Swap-timeslot. An event that
meets the probability between 10%×PAR and
20%×PAR is swapped with the timeslot of another
event, while the rooms of both events are not
changed.

c)The pitch adjustment move-location. An event that
meets the probability between 20%×PAR and
30%×PAR is randomly moved to any free feasible
location in the new harmony solution.

d) The pitch adjustment swap-location. An event that
meets the probability between 30%×PAR and
40%×PAR is randomly swapped with another event
while the feasibility is maintained.

e)The pitch adjustment exchange-location. An event
that meets the probability between 40%×PAR and
50%×PAR is randomly exchanged with another two
events while the feasibility is maintained.

f)The pitch adjustment swap-distinct-timeslots. An
event that meets the probability between 50%×PAR
and 60%×PAR is adjusted as follows: (1) select all
the events that have the same timeslot as first event.
(2) select a timeslot in random . (3) simply swap all
the events in timeslot with all the events in other
timeslot without changing the rooms.

g) The pitch adjustment move-room. An event that
meets the probability between 60%×PAR and
70%×PAR is moved to any free feasible room while
the timeslot is not changed.

h) The pitch adjustment Swap-room. An event that
meets the probability between 70%×PAR and
80%×PAR swaps its room with a room of another
event in the same timeslot while reserving the
feasibility.
